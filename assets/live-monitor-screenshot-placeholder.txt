PLACEHOLDER FOR LIVE MONITOR SCREENSHOT

Please replace ../assets/live-monitor-screenshot.png with an actual screenshot showing:

1. The live monitor in action
2. Multiple sections visible (Usage, Sessions, Progress, Alerts)
3. Some example alerts
4. The terminal should be large enough to show all sections clearly

Suggested terminal size: At least 80x30 characters

You can take the screenshot while running:
claude-monitor-live --reset-hours 6 --alert-threshold 65

The screenshot should show the beautiful TUI interface with:
- Cyan borders
- Color-coded progress bar
- Real-time alerts
- All four sections clearly visible
