PLACEHOLDER FOR LIVE MONITOR SCREENSHOT

Please replace ../assets/live-monitor-screenshot.png with an actual screenshot showing:

1. The live monitor in action
2. Multiple sections visible (Usage, Sessions, Progress, Alerts)
3. The new Current Rate and Safe Rate comparison
4. The rate indicator bar (green/yellow/red)
5. Some example alerts
6. The terminal should be large enough to show all sections clearly

Suggested terminal size: At least 80x30 characters

You can take the screenshot while running:
claude-monitor-live --reset-hours 6 --alert-threshold 65

The screenshot should show the beautiful TUI interface with:
- Cyan borders
- Color-coded progress bar
- Real-time alerts
- All four sections clearly visible
